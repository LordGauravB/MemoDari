This is a comprehensive reference guide defining every table and column in your schema, mapped directly to how your Python application logic (`FactDari.py`, `gamification.py`, `analytics_factdari.py`) utilizes them.

---

### 1. Table: `GamificationProfile`
**Definition:** Stores the "save state" for a user. Currently, your app defaults to using `ProfileID=1`, but the design supports multiple users.
**Primary Use:** Displaying the top-left stats (Level/XP) and tracking lifetime progress for achievements.

| Column | Data Type | Definition & Application Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ProfileID`** | `INT (PK)` | **Identity.** The app calls `get_active_profile_id()` to fetch this. Defaults to 1. All user actions are linked to this ID. |
| **`XP`** | `INT` | **Experience Points.** Updated by `gamification.award_xp()` whenever a user reviews a fact, adds a card, or unlocks an achievement. |
| **`Level`** | `INT` | **Current Level.** Calculated in Python based on `XP` curves defined in `config.py` and stored here to avoid recalculating it on every render. |
| **`TotalReviews`** | `INT` | **Lifetime Counter.** Incremented in `track_fact_view`. Used to unlock "Review Master" style achievements. |
| **`TotalKnown`** | `INT` | **Lifetime Counter.** Incremented when user clicks the "Known" (Easy) button. Triggers "Knowledge" achievements. |
| **`TotalFavorites`** | `INT` | **Lifetime Counter.** Incremented when user clicks the "Star" button. |
| **`TotalAdds`** / **`Edits`** / **`Deletes`** | `INT` | **Activity Counters.** Incremented during CRUD operations to reward content curation. |
| **`TotalAITokens`** / **`TotalAICost`** | `INT/DECIMAL` | **Usage Tracking.** Aggregates ALL LLM costs from `AIUsageLogs` (both explanations and question generation). Used to display total spend or potentially limit usage. |
| **`CurrentStreak`** | `INT` | **Streak Counter.** Updated by `daily_checkin()`. Resets to 0 if `LastCheckinDate` is older than yesterday. |
| **`LongestStreak`** | `INT` | **High Score.** Stores the highest value `CurrentStreak` has ever reached. |
| **`LastCheckinDate`** | `DATE` | **State Marker.** The last date the user opened the app or reviewed a card. Used to calculate if a streak continues or breaks. |

### 2. Table: `Categories`
**Definition:** Organizational buckets for facts.
**Primary Use:** Populating the dropdown filter in the main window and Add/Edit popups.

| Column | Data Type | Definition & Application Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`CategoryID`** | `INT (PK)` | **Reference.** Linked by `Facts` table. |
| **`CategoryName`** | `NVARCHAR` | **Display Label.** Shown in the `Combobox` dropdown in the UI. Must be unique. |
| **`Description`** | `NVARCHAR` | **Metadata.** Optional text describing the category (currently unused in UI). |
| **`IsActive`** | `BIT` | **Soft Delete.** If set to 0, the category won't appear in the dropdown, but historical data remains. |
| **`CreatedDate`** | `DATETIME` | **Audit.** When the category was created. |
| **`CreatedBy`** | `INT (FK)` | **Owner.** Points to `GamificationProfile.ProfileID`. All analytics and counts are scoped to the active profile’s categories only. |

### 3. Table: `Facts`
**Definition:** The central repository of flashcard content.
**Primary Use:** Stores the actual text displayed on the card.

| Column | Data Type | Definition & Application Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`FactID`** | `INT (PK)` | **Reference.** The core ID used throughout the app to link logs, user states, and AI usage. |
| **`CategoryID`** | `INT (FK)` | **Grouping.** Links the fact to a Category. |
| **`Content`** | `NVARCHAR` | **Payload.** The actual text string displayed on the `fact_label` in the GUI. |
| **`DateAdded`** | `DATE` | **Timeline.** Used in analytics to show "Facts Added Over Time". |
| **`TotalViews`** | `INT` | **Global Stat.** A counter of how many times this fact has been seen by *anyone* (global popularity). |
| **`QuestionsRefreshCountdown`** | `INT` | **Question Refresh Countdown.** Starts at 50, decrements by 1 each review. When it reaches 0, delete old questions, regenerate fresh ones, and reset to 50. |
| **`CreatedBy`** | `INT (FK)` | **Owner.** Points to `GamificationProfile.ProfileID`. Used to scope analytics so each profile only sees its own facts. |

---

### 4. Table: `ProfileFacts`
**Definition:** Stores **user-specific** relationships to facts.

| **`PersonalReviewCount`** | `INT` | **Personal Stat.** How many times *this specific user* has viewed this fact. Used for "Spaced Repetition" logic (future proofing). |
| **`IsFavorite`** | `BIT` | **UI State.** `1` = Gold Star icon, `0` = White Star icon. Filter used when "Favorites" is selected in dropdown. |

| **`LastViewedByUser`** | `DATETIME` | **Sorting.** Used by analytics to determine "Least Reviewed" or "Neglected" cards. |
| **`KnownSince`** | `DATETIME` | **Learning Velocity.** Timestamp of when the fact was first marked as "Known". Set only once via `COALESCE(KnownSince, dbo.LondonNow())` when toggling to known. Used in analytics to calculate "days to know" for the Learning Velocity chart. |
