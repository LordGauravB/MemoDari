## Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
- Database connection settings
- Database driver override via `FACTDARI_DB_DRIVER` (e.g., `ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server` or `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server`)
- With ODBC 18, you may also need:
  - `FACTDARI_DB_ENCRYPT` (e.g., `yes`/`no`)
  - `FACTDARI_DB_TRUST_CERT` (e.g., `yes` if using local/dev without a trusted cert)
- Window dimensions and positioning
- Color schemes
- Font settings
- UI element sizes
- Inactivity timeout behavior
- XP reward tuning

### Inactivity Timeout
- `FACTDARI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default: `300`): seconds of no input before the app considers you idle.
- `FACTDARI_IDLE_END_SESSION` (default: `true`): when idle, end the active session as timed out. If set to `false`, only the current fact view is finalized as timed out and the session remains open.

### XP Rewards
- `FACTDARI_XP_REVIEW_BASE` (default: `1`): base XP per completed view
- `FACTDARI_XP_REVIEW_GRACE_SECONDS` (default: `2`): seconds before counting a view
- `FACTDARI_XP_REVIEW_BONUS_STEP_SECONDS` (default: `5`): +1 XP per step beyond grace
- `FACTDARI_XP_REVIEW_BONUS_CAP` (default: `5`): max time-based bonus
- `FACTDARI_XP_FAVORITE` (default: `1`), `FACTDARI_XP_KNOWN` (default: `10`), `FACTDARI_XP_ADD` (default: `2`), `FACTDARI_XP_EDIT` (default: `1`), `FACTDARI_XP_DELETE` (default: `0`)
- `FACTDARI_XP_DAILY_CHECKIN` (default: `2`): XP on daily streak check-in

### AI Configuration
- `FACTDARI_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key (required for AI explanations and question generation)
- The AI feature uses the DeepSeek V4 Pro model (`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`) via OpenRouter
- `FACTDARI_AI_MODEL`: override the model id (default: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`)
- `FACTDARI_AI_ENDPOINT`: override the API endpoint (default: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`)
- `FACTDARI_AI_REFERER` / `FACTDARI_AI_TITLE`: optional OpenRouter attribution headers (`HTTP-Referer` / `X-Title`)
- `FACTDARI_AI_REASONING_ENABLED` (default: `false`): runs DeepSeek V4 Pro in Non-Think mode for fast, direct answers; set to `true` to enable thinking
- `FACTDARI_AI_PROMPT_COST_PER_1K` (default: `0.0021`) and `FACTDARI_AI_COMPLETION_COST_PER_1K` (default: `0.0044`): per-1K-token prices used for cost tracking ($2.10 / $4.40 per 1M tokens)
- Cost tracking is automatic based on token usage
- All AI usage is logged to the `AIUsageLogs` table for analytics
- Questions are cached in the `Questions` table and refresh based on `QuestionsRefreshCountdown`

### Leveling Configuration
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_TOTAL_XP_L100` (default: `1000000`): total XP to reach Level 100
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND1_END` (default: `4`): last level of band 1
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND1_STEP` (default: `100`): XP per level for band 1
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND2_END` (default: `9`): last level of band 2
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND2_STEP` (default: `500`): XP per level for band 2
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND3_END` (default: `14`): last level of band 3
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND3_STEP` (default: `1000`): XP per level for band 3
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND4_END` (default: `19`): last level of band 4
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND4_STEP` (default: `5000`): XP per level for band 4
- `FACTDARI_LEVEL_CONST_END` (default: `98`): end level of the constant step band (start is `BAND4_END+1`; final step is at 99)

## How XP Works

- Per-view reviews: Awards XP when you finish viewing a fact and move away or the view is finalized by inactivity.
  - Base: +1 XP after a short grace (default 2s).
  - Time bonus: +1 for each additional step (default 5s) after grace, capped (default +5).
  - Max per view with defaults: 6 XP (1 base + 5 bonus).
- Daily check-in: The first time you start a reviewing session on a new day, you gain daily XP (default +2) and the app evaluates streak achievements (3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days).
- Actions: Small XP for common actions.
  - Favorite (mark ON): +1 XP (default).
  - Known (mark ON): +10 XP (default).
  - Add fact: +2 XP (default).
  - Edit fact: +1 XP (default).
  - Delete fact: +0 XP (default).
  - Note: These award when toggled/triggered; they are not 'first-time only' by default.
- Achievements: Unlock thresholds grant additional XP automatically across categories (known, favorites, reviews, adds, edits, deletes, streak). If you jump past multiple thresholds, you receive all applicable rewards.
- Leveling:
  - Level step sizes are designed to total exactly 1,000,000 XP at Level 100 (configurable via env):
    - Level 1-4: +100 XP per level (FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND1_STEP)
    - Level 5-9: +500 XP per level (FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND2_STEP)
    - Level 10-14: +1000 XP per level (FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND3_STEP)
    - Level 15-19: +5000 XP per level (FACTDARI_LEVEL_BAND4_STEP)
    - Level 20-98: constant step automatically fitted so that the total is exactly `FACTDARI_LEVEL_TOTAL_XP_L100`
    - Level 99->100: final step equals the exact remainder to hit the target total
  - Level 100 is gated - your stored Level stays at 99 until all achievements are unlocked, even if you meet the XP target.

All values are configurable via environment variables listed in "XP Rewards" above.
## Making This Repo Public

Before making the repository public:

- Hide local environment folders:
  - A `.gitignore` has been added to exclude `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, editor folders, etc. If `.venv/` was already committed, untrack it with:
    - `git rm -r --cached .venv`
    - `git commit -m "chore: stop tracking .venv"`
- Database host defaults:
  - Default DB server changed to `localhost\SQLEXPRESS`. Set environment variables to point to your own SQL Server if different.
- Email privacy:
  - Your past commits may include your email in Git metadata. Consider enabling GitHub email privacy and using your noreply address for future commits.
- Assets and licenses:
  - Ensure all images in `Resources/` are yours or properly licensed.
- Debug mode:
  - `analytics_factdari.py` runs the Flask app in debug for local use. Do not expose this publicly.
