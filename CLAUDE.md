# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

Install and run:

```bash
pip install -r util/requirements_factdari.txt
python factdari.py              # desktop widget (tkinter)
python analytics_factdari.py    # Flask dashboard at http://localhost:5000
```

Testing (pytest, config in [pytest.ini](pytest.ini)):

```bash
pytest                                              # run all; auto-writes HTML to templates/report.html
pytest tests/test_gamification.py                   # single file
pytest tests/test_gamification.py::TestLevelCalculation   # single class
pytest -m "not slow and not integration"            # skip DB/slow tests
pytest -m integration                               # DB-backed tests (needs SQL Server + FactDari DB)
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

Custom markers: `slow`, `integration` (needs DB), `ui` (needs tkinter). [tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) auto-blocks external HTTP (localhost only) and disables Flask-Limiter during tests.

Database setup: run [database_setup/factdari_setup.sql](database_setup/factdari_setup.sql) against SQL Server / SQL Server Express. Schema reference: [database_setup/schema_definitions.md](database_setup/schema_definitions.md).

## Architecture

Three Python modules at the repo root form the system. They share one SQL Server database (connection built by `config.get_connection_string()`, ODBC via `pyodbc`). There is no ORM — all SQL is hand-written and executed through `pyodbc` cursors.

**[factdari.py](factdari.py) — Desktop widget** (~3.9k lines, single `FactDariApp` class). A tkinter always-on-top frameless window. Owns the review loop: opens a `ReviewSessions` row in `start_reviewing()`, writes a `FactLogs` row per view in `track_fact_view()`, pauses the per-view timer whenever a modal opens (shortcuts, AI explain, edit/add/delete, question display, category dropdown — see README "Review Timer Pausing"), and finalizes views on inactivity via `IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Also embeds the OpenRouter client for on-demand explanations and question generation — any AI call writes an `AIUsageLogs` row with tokens/cost/latency.

**[analytics_factdari.py](analytics_factdari.py) — Flask dashboard** (~2.2k lines). Read-only over the same DB. Every chart/table endpoint is a separate route returning JSON; the frontend ([templates/analytics_factdari.html](templates/analytics_factdari.html) + [static/js](static/js)) renders via Chart.js. CSRF is on by default (Flask-WTF), and rate limiting is enforced via Flask-Limiter using `ANALYTICS_CONFIG['rate_limit_per_minute']`. Tests disable the limiter via the autouse fixture.

**[gamification.py](gamification.py) — XP / levels / streaks / achievements**. Single `Gamification` class backed by `GamificationProfile`, `Achievements`, `AchievementUnlocks`. `award_xp()` applies XP and recomputes level against the banded curve in `LEVELING_CONFIG`. `daily_checkin()` advances or resets `CurrentStreak` based on `LastCheckinDate`. Counter increments use an **allowlist** (`ALLOWED_COUNTER_FIELDS`) and an explicit field→SQL map — do not replace with dynamic field interpolation. `factdari.py` calls into this module; `analytics_factdari.py` only reads the resulting rows.

### Key cross-cutting conventions

- **[config.py](config.py) is the single source of truth.** Everything tunable — DB connection, ODBC driver, XP amounts, level bands, AI pricing/endpoint, idle timeout, analytics windows, colors/fonts, logging — reads from env vars with defaults there. Add new tunables here rather than hardcoding.
- **Logging** is via `config.setup_logging('factdari.<module>')` with rotating file handler in `logs/`. Reuse the helper instead of configuring `logging` directly.
- **Level 100 is gated**: even when XP crosses the threshold, stored `Level` caps at 99 until every achievement is unlocked. Any XP/level change should keep this invariant.
- **Analytics scoping**: `Facts.CreatedBy` and `Categories.CreatedBy` scope rows to the active profile. New analytics queries must filter by the active `ProfileID` to match existing charts.
- **Question refresh lifecycle**: `Facts.QuestionsRefreshCountdown` starts at 50 and decrements per review. Hitting 0 triggers deletion of old `Questions` for that fact, regeneration via OpenRouter, and reset to 50. Keep this contract if you touch question code.
- **OpenRouter**: model/endpoint/pricing live in `AI_PRICING` / `AI_REQUEST_CONFIG` (provider `openrouter`, model `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, endpoint `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`); the API key comes from `config.get_openrouter_api_key()` (`FACTDARI_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`). Every call must log to `AIUsageLogs` with input/output tokens, computed cost, latency, status, and provider — analytics and `GamificationProfile.TotalAI*` counters depend on it.
- **All DB datetimes use `dbo.LondonNow()`**, never `GETDATE()`. The scalar function is defined near the top of [database_setup/factdari_setup.sql](database_setup/factdari_setup.sql) (returns `SYSDATETIMEOFFSET() AT TIME ZONE 'GMT Standard Time'` cast to `DATETIME`) and must exist before any CREATE TABLE or write runs. Every column DEFAULT and every Python `INSERT ... VALUES (..., dbo.LondonNow(), ...)` depends on it.
- **Flask emits naive ISO datetimes** via `NaiveDatetimeJSONProvider` at the top of [analytics_factdari.py](analytics_factdari.py). The browser parses via `new Date(...)` and renders through the UK formatters below. Do NOT revert to Flask's default `http_date()` serializer — it tags values as GMT and the browser then double-offsets BST.
- **UK date format everywhere user-facing**: `DD-MM-YYYY` for dates, `DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS` for datetimes (24-hour, space separator). Python chart-label builders call `_to_uk_date_label(val)` in [analytics_factdari.py](analytics_factdari.py); JS table/card renders call `formatDate(value)` / `formatDateTime(value)` in [static/js/analytics.js](static/js/analytics.js). Never use `.toLocaleString()` / `.toLocaleDateString()` / `date.isoformat()` for display — they leak en-US month-first or ISO format through.
- **Streak math uses London date from SQL**: `Gamification._london_today(cur)` in [gamification.py](gamification.py) and the `fetch_query("SELECT CAST(dbo.LondonNow() AS DATE)")` pattern in `analytics_factdari.calculate_review_streak` — don't use Python `date.today()` / `datetime.now().date()` for comparisons against `LastCheckinDate` or `FactLogs.ReviewDate`, they drift on non-UK hosts.
- **Deleted-fact policy is split.** Aggregate totals (Total AI Cost/Tokens, Review counts, distribution pies) include rows whose `FactID` is now NULL — the activity really happened and the numbers must stay truthful. Ranking and audit tables (Most Explained Facts, Last 50 Card Reviews, etc.) filter with `WHERE rl.FactID IS NOT NULL` / `INNER JOIN Facts` because ghost rows are noise. The one exception is the Recent AI Usage Log: `AIUsageLogs.FactContentSnapshot` is populated at INSERT time via a subquery in [factdari.py](factdari.py), so that audit log uses `COALESCE(f.Content, ai.FactContentSnapshot, 'Deleted Fact')` and keeps deleted-fact entries readable.

### Database tables to know

`Categories`, `Facts`, `ProfileFacts` (per-profile state: `IsFavorite`, `IsEasy`, `KnownSince`, `LastViewedByUser`), `ReviewSessions`, `FactLogs` (one per view/action, can outlive deleted facts via content snapshot), `GamificationProfile`, `Achievements`, `AchievementUnlocks`, `AIUsageLogs` (carries `FactContentSnapshot` captured at insert for post-deletion rendering), `Questions`, `QuestionLogs`. Full column-level docs in [database_setup/schema_definitions.md](database_setup/schema_definitions.md).

## Platform notes

Windows-only for the desktop widget (uses `pywin32`, `ctypes.wintypes`, `pyttsx3` SAPI). The dev shell is Windows **PowerShell** (win32) — use PowerShell syntax (`$env:VAR`, `$null`, backtick line-continuation) for shell scripting; a bash tool is also available for POSIX one-liners. The cross-platform `pip`/`python`/`pytest` commands above run unchanged in either. `analytics_factdari.py` runs Flask in debug for local use — do not expose publicly.
